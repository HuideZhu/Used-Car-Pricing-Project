With annual sales of over US$350 billion, the used vehicle industry represents almost half of the U.S. auto retail market and is still growing rapidly. In the United States, the number of used-car transactions is approximately three times as large as the number of new-car transactions. It is no surprise then that this active secondary market no doubt has great impact on the primary auto market. But despite its large size, the used car market has traditionally less organized than the primary market. This creates inefficiencies and hinders price discovery, making it difficult to quote prices for both consumers and retailers alike.

However, the growth of the internet has created a revolution in the availability of information about the secondary car market. Digital platforms like Craiglist have made public information that was once only available inhouse to big car dealers. Our team wishes to use big data methods to leverage this information to accuarately predict the price of used cars and the likelihood of a given car to be sold. This information will be invaluable to secondhand car dealers as the ability to accurately price used vehicles lies at the cornerstone of their business.
